            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I have obtained Master's in Applied Math during which I learned how to optimize 
            different problems using Math skills, all from calculating number of cookies 
            to fit in a tray to optimizing investments into put and call options. However, 
            after being exposed to MATLAB, I've decided to pursue programming and developed 
            a passion for Web Programming.</p>
            <p>After graduating, I self taught myself HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and became 
            a freelance Frontend Web Developer. Proud to say, that my detailed oriented and 
            stubborn nature got me good response from clients which required pixel perfect 
            transition from PSDs to live websites.</p>
            <p>My goal is to become a Web Developer with a passion of implementing math and 
            problem solving skills for custom features of a website. Recently I've decided 
            to expand my skills and become a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
